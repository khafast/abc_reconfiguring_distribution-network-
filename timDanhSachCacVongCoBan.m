% CYCLEBASIS - find a basis for the cycle subspace of a graph/network
% usage: y=cyclebasis(G)
%        y=cyclebasis(G,form)
% 
% This can be useful for obtaining the equations for Kirchhoff's second
% law for complicated networks.  The cycles in the basis (fundamental
% cycle) correspond to a set of linearly independent conservation
% equations.
%
% INPUTS: G, form
%  G is the adjacency matrix of the undirected graph/network, with G(i,j)=1
%   if vertices i and j are connected by a single edge.  Graph edges have
%   no direction.  G can be full or sparse and real or logical.
%   Non-logical matrices are set to G=(G~=0).
%   Non-symmetric inputs are symmetrised by G=(G+G')>0.
%  form (optional) is a string specifying the form of output:
%   'adj' (default) for the adjacency matrices of the cycles;
%   'path' for the lists of vertices which the cycles pass through.
%
% OUTPUTS: y
%  y is a cell array of fundamental cycles (single loops) that form a basis
%   of the cycle subspace.  All cycles and disjoint unions of cycles are a
%   product (using xor) of fundamental cycles.  If form='adj', the
%   adjacency matrices of the fundamental cycles are given, and any cycle
%   satisfies C = xor(...(xor(y{i1},y{i2}),...),y{ik}) for some i1,...,ik.
%   If form='path' then the cycles are specified as paths,
%   e.g. [1,2,4] for the cycle passing through vertices 1,2,4.
%
% ALGORITHM:
%  For each component of the graph, find a spanning tree, then for each
%  missing edge add the edge to the tree and successively remove all leaves
%  and what remains is a fundamental cycle.  So for a connected graph of v
%  vertices and e edges, there are e-v+1 fundamental cycles.
%
% EXAMPLE: cycle subspace basis of complete graph on 3 vertices (with &
%  without self-loops at every vertex) and 2 copies of same:
%    cyclebasis(ones(3,3),'path')          % returns {1,2,[1,2,3],3}
%    cyclebasis(ones(3,3)-eye(3,3),'path') % returns {[1,2,3]}
%    cyclebasis(blkdiag(ones(3,3)-eye(3,3),ones(3,3)-eye(3,3)),'path')
%                                          % returns {[1,2,3],[4,5,6]}
